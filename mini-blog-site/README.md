# Build a Blog
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


- Inside the `posts` directory create a HTML file for each post, named `post-1.html`, `post-2.html` etc. Create at least 3 posts.
- In the `index.html` file list all the posts available, showing the main picture, title, and the first few lines of content. At the end, put a `read more` link that points to the full blog post
- Inside each individual post page, put the main image, the title, the full content and some extra images
- In each individual blog post page, add a 'return to homepage' link.

Notes:

- Copy the content from some wikipedia page, or from whatever source you prefer, but try to give it a theme. Some ideas:
  - a blog about your favourite video games
  - a blog about your favourite tv series
  - a blog about your favourite cartoons or anime
  - a blog about comics
  - a blog about your favourite bands
- Try to use as many things you learned as possile
  - put some floating image in the text
  - add some background color
  - add colored links
- Use the examples below as a reference, but try to come up with your own style ideas
